# CST211-Lab11
Lab 13
Shortest Path

Description

* Read the data file for Assignment 13 and store it into the graph created for Assignment 12 (multi-list). 
* The format for the file is:

Start Node,End Node,Path,Mileage

Write a program that allows the user to enter in any starting point and any ending point and your program will provide the shortest (distance) path to the desired destination. 

Show the path from the source to the destination as well as the estimated time to arrive at your destination 
(assume you go the speed limit and that I-5 is 65 mph while all other roads are 55 mph).

Remember, this is an algorithm that uses a graph. It is not (necessarily) a class and it is definitely not a part of or derived from the graph class.

Deliverables

One file including:
* Your code
* Your test(s) similar to Lab1_test.cpp & Lab2_test.cpp and their results
